    "Seneca was a famous Roman statesman, philosopher, and Stoic (first century CE). Seneca has, perhaps, the largest body of stoic writings that has survived from ancient times. His letters to Lucilius are some of his most famous works and provide an interesting subject for the application of unsupervied machine learning.\n"
