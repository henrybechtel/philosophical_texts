       "'On the Shortness of Life \\n\\nLUCIUS ANNAEUS SENECA \\nTRANSLATED BY GARETH D. WILLIAMS \\n\\n\\n\\n(i.i) Most of mankind, Paulinus, complains about natures meanness, \\nbecause our allotted span of life is so short, and because this stretch \\nof time that is given to us runs its course so quickly, so rapidly — so \\nmuch so that, with very few exceptions, life leaves the rest of us in \\nthe lurch just when we re getting ready to live. And its not just the \\nmasses and the unthinking crowd that complain at what they per- \\nceive as this universal evil; the same feeling draws complaints even \\nfrom men of distinction. Hence that famous dictum of the greatest \\nof physicians: \"Life is short, art long.\" 1 (2) Hence also Aristotle\\'s \\ngrievance, 2 most unbecoming a philosopher, when he called nature \\nto account for bestowing so much time on animals that they can live \\nfor five or ten human life spans, while so much shorter a limit is set \\nfor humans, even though they are born to do so many great things. \\n\\n(3) It\\'s not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste \\nmuch of it. Life is long enough, and it\\'s been given to us in generous \\nmeasure for accomplishing the greatest things, if the whole of it is \\nwell invested. But when life is squandered through soft and careless \\nliving, and when it\\'s spent on no worthwhile pursuit, death finally \\npresses and we realize that the life which we didn\\'t notice passing \\nhas passed away. (4) So it is: the life we are given isn\\'t short but we \\nmake it so; we\\'re not ill provided but we are wasteful of life. Just as \\nimpressive and princely wealth is squandered in an instant when it \\npasses into the hands of a poor manager, but wealth however modest \\ngrows through careful deployment if it is entrusted to a responsible \\nguardian, just so our lifetime offers ample scope to the person who \\nmaps it out well. \\n\\n(2.1) Why do we complain about nature? It has acted generously: \\nlife, if you know how to use it, is long. But one person\\'s held in the \\ngrip of voracious avarice, another by the kind of diligence that bus- \\nies itself with pointless enterprises. This one\\'s sodden with wine, \\nanother slack with idleness. This one\\'s tired out by his political ambi- \\ntion, which always hangs on the judgment of others, while another\\'s \\npassionate desire for trading drives him headlong over every land \\n\\n\\n\\nand every sea in hope of profit. A passion for soldiering torments \\nsome men, who are always either bent on inflicting dangers on oth- \\ners or worried about danger to themselves. Some are worn down \\nby the voluntary enslavement of thankless attendance on the great. \\n(2) Many are kept busy either striving after other people\\'s wealth or \\ncomplaining about their own. Many who have no consistent goal in \\nlife are thrown from one new design to another by a fickleness that is \\nshifting, never settled and ever dissatisfied with itself. Some have no \\ngoal at all toward which to steer their course, but death takes them \\nby surprise as they gape and yawn. I cannot therefore doubt the truth \\nof that seemingly oracular utterance of the greatest of poets: \"Scant \\nis the part of life in which we live.\" 3 All the rest of existence is not \\nliving but merely time. \\n\\n(3) Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don\\'t allow \\nus to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth; \\nbut they press down on them, keeping them lowered and fixed on \\nmere desire. It\\'s never possible for their victims to return to their \\ntrue selves. If by chance they ever find some respite, they still roll \\nrestlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind \\nhas settled; they never find full relaxation from their desires. (4) You \\nthink I\\'m talking only of those whose faults are admitted? Look at \\nthose whose prosperity draws crowds: they are choked by their own \\ngoods. How many have found their wealth a burden! How many are \\ndrained of their blood by their eloquence and their daily preoccupa- \\ntion with showing off their abilities! How many are sickly pale from \\ntheir incessant pleasures! How many are left with no freedom from \\nthe multitude of their besieging clients! In short, look over all of \\nthem from lowest to highest: this person summons counsel to plead \\nhis case, another answers the call; this one stands trial, another acts \\nfor the defense, another presides as judge; no one acts as his own \\nchampion, but each is wasted for another\\'s sake. Ask about those in- \\nfluential citizens whose names are studiously memorized, and you\\'ll \\nsee that the following distinctions tell them apart: the first cultivates \\na second, the second a third; no one is his own man. (5) Again certain \\npeople give vent to the most irrational outbursts of anger: they com- \\nplain about the haughtiness of their superiors, because the latter were \\ntoo busy to receive them when they wanted an audience. Dare anyone \\ncomplain about another\\'s arrogance when he himself never has time \\n\\n\\n\\nto spare for himself? Yet the great man has occasionally, albeit with a \\ndisdainful expression, condescended to look on you, whoever you are; \\nhe has deigned to listen to your words, he has allowed you to walk \\nat his side. But you never thought fit to look on yourself or to listen \\nto yourself. And so you\\'ve no reason to expect a return from anyone \\nfor those attentions of yours, since you offered them not because you \\nwanted another\\'s company but because you were incapable of com- \\nmuning with yourself. \\n\\n(3.1) Though all the brilliant minds that have shone over the ages \\nagree on this one point, they could never adequately express their \\nastonishment at this dark fog in the human mind. No one lets anyone \\nseize his estates, and if a trivial dispute arises about boundary lines, \\nthere\\'s a rush to stones and arms; but people let others trespass on \\ntheir existence — or rather, they go so far as to invite in those who\\'ll \\ntake possession of their lives. You\\'ll find no one willing to distribute \\nhis money; but to how many people each of us shares out his life! \\nMen are thrifty in guarding their private property, but as soon as it \\ncomes to wasting time, they are most extravagant with the one com- \\nmodity for which it\\'s respectable to be greedy. \\n\\n(2) And so I\\'d like to collar one of the older crowd: \"I see that \\nyou\\'ve reached the limit of human life, you\\'re pressing hard on your \\nhundredth year or more; come now, submit your life to an audit. Cal- \\nculate how much of your time has been taken up by a moneylender, \\nhow much by a mistress, how much by a patron, how much by a cli- \\nent, how much in arguing with your wife, in punishing your slaves, in \\nrunning about the city on social duties. Add to your calculations the \\nillnesses that we\\'ve inflicted on ourselves, and also the time that has \\nlain idle: you\\'ll see that you\\'ve fewer years than you count. (3) Look \\nback and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few \\ndays turned out as you\\'d intended; when you were ever at your own \\ndisposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind \\nwas free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in \\nsuch a long life; how many have plundered your existence without \\nyour being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been \\nlost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms \\nof society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You\\'ll \\ncome to realize that you\\'re dying before your time.\" \\n\\n(4) What, then, is the reason for this? Your sort live as if you\\'re \\n\\n\\n\\ngoing to live forever, your own human frailty never enters your head, \\nyou don\\'t keep an eye on how much time has passed already. You \\nwaste time as if it comes from a source full to overflowing, when all \\nthe while that very day which is given over to someone or something \\nmay be your last. You\\'re like ordinary mortals in fearing everything, \\nyou\\'re like immortals in coveting everything. (5) You\\'ll hear many say: \\n\"After my fiftieth year I\\'ll retire to a life of leisure; my sixtieth year \\nwill bring release from all my duties.\" And what guarantee, may I \\nask, do you have that your life will last longer? Who will allow those \\narrangements of yours to proceed according to plan? Are you not \\nashamed to keep for yourself only the remnants of your existence, and \\nto allocate to philosophical thought only that portion of time which \\ncan\\'t be applied to any business? How late it is to begin living just \\nwhen life must come to an end! What foolish obliviousness to our \\nmortality to put off wise plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth year, and to \\nwant to begin life from a point that few have reached! \\n\\n(4.1) You\\'ll find that the most powerful men of high position \\ndrop words in which they pray for leisure, praise it, and prefer it to \\nall their blessings. They sometimes long to step down from that pin- \\nnacle of theirs, if they can safely do so; for even without any external \\ndisturbance or shock, fortune crashes down on itself under its own \\nweight. \\n\\n(2) The divine Augustus, to whom the gods gave more than to \\nany man, never ceased to pray for rest for himself and to seek release \\nfrom the affairs of state. Every conversation of his kept coming back \\nto this theme, that he was hoping for leisure; he would relieve his \\ntoils with this sweet, even if illusory, consolation, the thought that \\none day he would live for himself. (3) In a letter that he sent to the \\nsenate, when he had given an assurance that his retirement would \\nnot be wanting in dignity and not be inconsistent with his former \\nprestige, I find the following words: \"But such things are more im- \\npressive in their fulfillment than in their promise. Yet my deep desire \\nfor that time, which I have long prayed for, has led me to anticipate \\nsomething of its delight by the pleasure of words, since the joy of \\nthat reality is still slow in coming.\" 4 (4) Leisure seemed such a desir- \\nable thing that, because he couldn\\'t enjoy it in reality, he enjoyed the \\nthought of it in advance. He who saw that the world depended on \\nhim and him alone, who determined the fortunes of individuals and \\n\\n\\n\\nnations, he was happiest in looking forward to that day on which he \\nwould lay aside his greatness. (5) He knew by experience how much \\nsweat was wrung from him by those blessings that gleamed the world \\nover; he knew the scale of the hidden anxieties they veiled. 5 Forced \\nto contend in arms first with his fellow citizens, then with his col- \\nleagues, and finally with his relatives, he shed blood by land and sea. \\nDriven by war through Macedonia, Sicily, Egypt, Syria, and Asia and \\nalmost every known land, he turned his armies to foreign wars when \\nthey were weary of slaughtering Romans. While he was pacifying the \\nAlps and subjugating enemies embedded in the heart of the peace- \\nful empire, and while he was extending its boundaries beyond the \\nRhine and Euphrates and Danube, in the city itself Murena, Caepio, \\nLepidus, Egnatius, and others were whetting their swords against \\nhim. (6) He had not yet escaped their intrigues when his daughter \\nand so many noble paramours, bound by adultery as if by an oath of \\nallegiance, kept causing him alarm in his now-failing years — as did \\nIullus and a woman once again posing a threat with her Antony. 6 He \\nhad cut away these sores, limbs and all, but others kept growing up \\nin their place; as if overburdened with blood, the body politic was \\nalways hemorrhaging somewhere. That is why Augustus prayed for \\nleisure, and why he found relief from his labors in hoping for it and \\nthinking of it; this was the prayer of the man who could grant the \\nprayers of other men. \\n\\n(5.1) Marcus Cicero was storm-tossed among the likes of Catiline \\nand Clodius, of Pompey and Crassus, declared enemies on the one \\nside, doubtful friends on the other. 7 He was buffeted along with the \\nship of state, which he tried to keep steady as it was going down, but \\nhe was finally swept away. He was neither at ease in prosperity nor \\ncapable of withstanding adversity; how many times does he curse \\nthat very consulship of his, 8 which he had extolled not without rea- \\nson but without ceasing! (2) How pitiful are the words that he wrings \\nfrom himself in a letter written to Atticus, when the elder Pompey \\nhad been defeated and his son was still trying to revive his shattered \\nforces in Spain! 9 \"You ask,\" he says, \"what I\\'m doing here? I\\'m linger- \\ning in my Tusculan estate, half-free.\" 10 After that, he goes on to other \\nstatements in which he bemoans his former life, complains about \\nthe present, and despairs of the future. (3) \"Half-free,\" Cicero said \\nof himself. But needless to say, the sage will never resort to such an \\n\\n\\n\\nabject term. He will never be half-free but will always enjoy complete \\nand unalloyed liberty. Not subject to any constraints, he will be his \\nown master and tower above all others. For what can there be above \\nthe man who rises above fortune? \\n\\n(6.1) Livius Drusus 11 was a vigorously energetic man who, \\nthronged about by a huge crowd from the whole of Italy, had agitated \\nfor radical legislation and provoked the kind of troubles the Gracchi \\nhad. But he could see no clear way out for his policies, which he was \\nunable to carry through and which, once started, it was no longer \\nan option to abandon. He is said to have cursed the life of constant \\nactivity that he\\'d led from its very beginnings, saying that he was the \\nonly person who had never had a holiday even as a boy. While he \\nwas still a ward and had yet to assume the adult toga, he ventured to \\nplead before juries on behalf of defendants and to exert his special \\ninfluence in the courts — to such effect, in fact, that it\\'s generally ac- \\ncepted that he captured several verdicts against the odds. (2) Where \\nwould such precocious ambition not find an outlet? You might have \\nknown that such premature presumptuousness would lead to disaster \\nboth for him and for the state. And so it was too late when he began \\ncomplaining that he\\'d never had a holiday, since he\\'d been a trouble- \\nmaker and a burden to the forum from his boyhood. It is unclear \\nwhether he died by his own hand. He fell suddenly from a wound \\nto the groin; some doubted whether his death was self-inflicted, no \\none that it was timely. \\n\\n(3) It would be superfluous to mention more figures who, although \\nthey seemed to others the happiest of mortals, themselves gave true \\ntestimony against themselves when they expressed intense hatred for \\nevery act of their lives. Yet by these complaints they changed neither \\nthemselves nor anyone else; for after the outburst, their feelings re- \\nverted to their normal state. (4) In reality, your life, even if you live \\na thousand years and more, will be compressed into the merest span \\nof time; those vices of yours will swallow up any number of lifetimes. \\nTo be sure, this span of time, which good management prolongs even \\nthough it naturally hurries on, must in your case escape you quickly; \\nfor you fail to seize it and hold it back, and you do nothing to delay \\nthat speediest of all things, but you allow it to pass as if it were some- \\nthing overabundant that we can get back again. \\n\\n(7.1) In fact, among the worst cases I count also those who give \\n\\n\\n\\ntheir time to nothing but drink and lust; for these are the most \\nshameful preoccupations of all. Other people, even if the semblance \\nof glory that grips them is false, nevertheless go astray in respectable \\nfashion. You can cite for me people who are greedy, those quick to \\nanger, or people who busy themselves with unjust hatreds or wars; \\nbut all of them sin in a more manly fashion. It is those abandoned \\nto the belly and lust who bear the stain of dishonor. (2) Scrutinize \\nevery moment of such people\\'s lives, and note how much time they \\nspend on their ledger-keeping, how much on setting traps or fearing \\nthem, how much on cultivating others or being cultivated by others, \\nhow much on giving or receiving bail, how much on dinner parties \\nwhich have themselves become business: you\\'ll see that their affairs, \\nwhether good or bad, allow them no time to draw breath. \\n\\n(3) To sum up, everyone agrees that no one area of activity can \\nbe successfully pursued by someone who is preoccupied — rhetoric \\ncannot, nor can the liberal arts — since the distracted mind takes \\nin nothing really deeply but rejects everything that is, so to speak, \\npounded into it. Nothing is less characteristic of a man preoccupied \\nthan living: there is no knowledge that is harder to acquire. Instruc- \\ntors of other disciplines are two a penny; indeed, mere boys have \\nbeen seen to master some of these disciplines so thoroughly that \\nthey could even be masters in the classroom. But learning how to \\nlive takes a whole lifetime, and — you\\'ll perhaps be more surprised \\nat this — it takes a whole lifetime to learn how to die. 12 (4) So many \\nmen of the highest station have set aside all their encumbrances, \\nrenounced their wealth, their business, their pleasures, and right up \\nto the very end of life they have made it their sole aim to know how \\nto live. Nevertheless, the majority of them depart from life admit- \\nting that they did not yet have such knowledge — still less have those \\nothers attained it. (5) Believe me, it\\'s the mark of a great man, and \\none rising above human weakness, to allow no part of his time to \\nbe skimmed off. Accordingly, such a person\\'s life is extremely long \\nbecause he\\'s kept available for himself the whole of whatever amount \\nof time he had. None of it lay fallow and uncultivated, and none of \\nit was under another\\'s control; for being a most careful guardian of \\nhis time, he found nothing worth exchanging for it. And so that man \\nhad enough time; but those deprived of much of their life by the \\npublic have necessarily had too little. \\n\\n\\n\\n(6) Nor should you imagine that those people aren\\'t sometimes \\nconscious of their loss. Certainly you\\'ll hear many of those burdened \\nby their great prosperity occasionally cry out amid their hordes of \\nclients or their pleadings of cases or their other respectable forms of \\nwretchedness: \"I\\'ve no chance to live.\" (7) Of course you don\\'t! All \\nthose who engage you in their business disengage you from yourself. \\nHow many days did that defendant of yours take from you? How \\nmany that candidate? Or that old lady, wearied as she is by burying \\nher heirs? Or that character who feigns illness to excite the greed of \\nlegacy hunters? Or that powerful friend who holds on to you not for \\ntrue friendship but for show? Check off, I say, and review the days \\nof your life: you\\'ll see that very few of them, and those the worthless \\nones, have stayed in your possession. (8) The man who\\'s achieved \\nthe high office he\\'d prayed for longs to lay it aside and repeatedly \\nsays: \"When will this year end?\" The man who puts on the games \\nthought it a great privilege that responsibility for giving them fell \\nto him. Now he says: \"When will I be free of them?\" That advocate \\nhas people competing for his attention throughout the forum; with \\nthe crowd he draws, he fills the whole place further than he can be \\nheard: \"When,\" he says, \"will there be a vacation?\" Everyone sends \\nhis life racing headlong and suffers from a longing for the future, a \\nloathing of the present. (9) But the person who devotes every sec- \\nond of his time to his own needs and who organizes each day as \\nif it were a complete life neither longs for nor is afraid of the next \\nday. For what new kind of pleasure is there that any hour can now \\nbring? Everything has been experienced, everything enjoyed to the \\nfull. For the rest, fortune may make arrangements as it wishes; his \\nlife has already reached safety. Addition can be made to this life, but \\nnothing taken away from it — and addition made in the way that a \\nman who is already satisfied and full takes a portion of food which he \\ndoesn\\'t crave and yet has room for. (10) So there\\'s no reason to believe \\nthat someone has lived long because he has gray hair and wrinkles: \\nhe\\'s not lived long but long existed. For suppose you thought that a \\nperson had sailed far who\\'d been caught in a savage storm as soon as \\nhe left harbor, and after being carried in this direction and that, was \\ndriven in circles over the same course by alternations of the winds \\nraging from different quarters: he didn\\'t have a long voyage, but he \\nwas long tossed about. \\n\\n\\n\\n(8.i) I am always astonished when I see people requesting the \\ntime of others and receiving a most accommodating response from \\nthose they approach. Both sides focus on the object of the request, \\nand neither side on time itself; it is requested as if it were nothing, \\ngranted as if it were nothing. People trifle with the most precious \\ncommodity of all; and it escapes their notice because its an im- \\nmaterial thing that doesn\\'t appear to the eyes, and for that reason \\nit\\'s valued very cheaply — or rather, it has practically no value at all. \\n(2) People set very great store by annuities and gratuities, and for \\nthese they hire out their services or their efforts or their attentions. \\nBut no one values time: all use it more than lavishly, as if it cost noth- \\ning. But if mortal danger threatens them, you\\'ll see the same people \\nclasping their doctors\\' knees; if they fear a capital charge, you\\'ll see \\nthem ready to spend all they have to stay alive. So great is the conflict \\nin their feelings. (3) But if each of us could see the number of years \\nbefore us as precisely as the years that have passed, how alarmed \\nwould be those who saw only a few years left, and how carefully \\nwould they use them! And yet it\\'s easy to manage an amount, how- \\never small, which is clearly defined; we have to be more careful in \\nconserving an amount that may give out at any time. \\n\\n(4) Yet there\\'s no reason to believe that those people are unaware \\nof how precious a commodity time is. They habitually say to those \\nthey love most intensely that they are ready to give them some of \\ntheir own years. And they do give them without knowing it; but they \\ngive in such a way that, without adding to the years of their loved \\nones, they subtract from themselves. But this very point, namely, \\nwhether they are depriving themselves, eludes them, and so they can \\nbear the loss of what goes unnoticed in the losing. (5) No one will \\nbring back the years, no one will restore you to your former self. Life \\nwill follow the path on which it began, and it will neither reverse \\nnor halt its course. It will cause no commotion at all, it will call no \\nattention to its own swiftness. It will glide on in silence. It will pro- \\nlong itself at neither a king\\'s command nor his people\\'s clamor; it \\nwill run on just as it started out on the first day, with no diversions \\nand no delays. And the outcome? You\\'ve been preoccupied while life \\nhurries on; death looms all the while, and like it or not, you have to \\naccommodate it. \\n\\n(9.1) Can there be anything sillier than the view of those people \\n\\n\\n\\nwho boast of their foresight? They are too busily preoccupied with \\nefforts to live better; they plan out their lives at the expense of life \\nitself. They form their purposes with the distant future in mind. Yet \\nthe greatest waste of life lies in postponement: it robs us of each day \\nin turn, and snatches away the present by promising the future. The \\ngreatest impediment to living is expectancy, which relies on tomor- \\nrow and wastes today. You map out what is in fortune\\'s hand but let \\nslip what\\'s in your own hand. What are you aiming at? What\\'s your \\ngoal? All that\\'s to come lies in uncertainty: live right now. (2) Hear \\nthe cry of the greatest of poets, who sings his salutary song as if \\ninspired with divine utterance: \\n\\nEach finest day of life for wretched mortals \\nis ever the first to flee. 13 \\n\\n\"Why are you holding back?\" he says. \"Why are you slow to action? \\nIf you don\\'t seize the day, it slips away.\" Even when you\\'ve seized it, \\nit will still slip away; and so you must compete with time\\'s quickness \\nin the speed with which you use it, and you must drink swiftly as \\nif from a fast-moving torrent that will not always flow. (3) This too \\nthe poet very aptly says in chastising interminable procrastination: \\nnot each best \"age\" but each best \"day.\" Carefree and unconcerned \\neven though time flies so quickly, why do you project for yourself \\nmonths and years in long sequence, to whatever extent your greed \\nsees fit? The poet is speaking to you about the day — about this very \\nday which is slipping away. (4) So can there be any doubt that each \\nfinest day is ever the first to flee for wretched mortals — that is, the \\npreoccupied? Old age takes their still childish minds unawares, and \\nthey meet it unprepared and unarmed; for they\\'ve made no provision \\nfor it. Suddenly, unsuspecting, they\\'ve stumbled upon it, without no- \\nticing that it was drawing nearer every day. (5) Just as conversation or \\nreading or some deep reflection beguiles travelers and they find that \\nthey\\'ve reached their destination before being aware of approaching \\nit, so with this ceaseless and extremely rapid journey of life, which we \\nmake at the same pace whether awake or sleeping: the preoccupied \\nbecome aware of it only at its end. \\n\\n(10.1) If I wanted to divide my subject into categories, each with \\nits proofs, I could come up with many arguments to demonstrate that \\nthe life of the preoccupied is very short. But Fabianus, 14 who was not \\n\\n\\n\\none of today s chair-holding professionals but a true philosopher of \\nthe old-fashioned sort, was in the habit of saying that we must battle \\nagainst the passions with a vigorous attack, not with nicety of argu- \\nment; the enemy line is to be turned by a full-frontal assault, not by \\ntiny pinpricks. He has no regard for mere quibbling, for vices are to \\nbe crushed, not merely nipped at. Nevertheless, for the preoccupied \\nto be censured for their distinctive failing, they are to be taught a \\nlesson, not simply given up for lost. \\n\\n(2) Life is divided into three parts: past, present, and future. Of \\nthese, the present is brief, the future doubtful, the past certain. For \\nthis last is the category over which fortune no longer has control, and \\nwhich cannot be brought back under anyone\\'s power. Preoccupied \\npeople lose this part; for they have no leisure to look back at the \\npast, and even if they had it, there\\'s no pleasure in recalling some- \\nthing regrettable. (3) And so they\\'re unwilling to turn their minds \\nback to times badly spent, and they dare not revisit the past because \\ntheir vices become obvious in retrospect — even those that insinu- \\nated themselves by the allurement of momentary pleasure. No one \\ngladly casts his thoughts back to the past except for the person whose \\nevery action has been subjected to his own self-assessment, which is \\ninfallible. (4) A man who\\'s been ambitious in the scale of his desires, \\narrogant in his disdainfulness, unrestrained in prevailing over others, \\ntreacherous in his deceptions, greedy in his plunderings, and lavish \\nin his prodigality — such a man must inevitably be afraid of his own \\nmemory. Yet this is the part of our existence that is consecrated and \\nset apart, elevated above all human vicissitudes and removed beyond \\nfortune\\'s sway, and harried by no poverty, no fear, no attacks of dis- \\nease. This part can be neither disrupted nor stolen away; our posses- \\nsion of it is everlasting and untroubled. Days are present only one at \\na time, and these only minute by minute; but all the days of time past \\nwill attend you at your bidding, and they will allow you to examine \\nthem and hold on to them at your will — something which preoccu- \\npied people have no time to do. (5) It takes a tranquil and untroubled \\nmind to roam freely over all the parts of life; but preoccupied minds, \\nas if under the yoke, cannot turn around and look backward. Their \\nlife therefore disappears into an abyss; and just as it does no good to \\npour any amount of liquid into a vessel if there\\'s nothing at the bot- \\ntom to receive and keep it, 15 so it makes no difference how much time \\n\\n\\n\\nwe are given if there\\'s nowhere for it to settle, and it\\'s allowed to pass \\nthrough the cracks and holes in the mind. (6) The present time is \\nvery brief — indeed, so very brief that to some people 16 it seems to be \\nnonexistent. For it\\'s always in motion, slipping by and hurrying on; \\nit ceases to be before it arrives, and it no more suffers delay than do \\nthe firmament or the heavenly bodies, whose ever- tireless movement \\nnever lets them remain in the same position. So the preoccupied are \\nconcerned with the present alone, and it is so fleeting that it can\\'t \\nbe grasped, and even that little amount is stolen away from them \\nbecause they\\'re pulled in many different directions. \\n\\n(11.1) In a word, do you want to know how briefly they really \\nlive? See how keen they are to live a long life. Enfeebled old men \\nbeg in their prayers for an additional few years; they pretend they are \\nyounger than they really are; they flatter themselves by this falsehood, \\nand deceive themselves as gladly as if they deceived fate at the same \\ntime. But when some real illness has at last reminded them that they \\nare mortal\\', how terrified they are when they die, as if they\\'re not leav- \\ning life but are being dragged from it! They cry out repeatedly that \\nthey\\'ve been fools because they\\'ve not really lived, and that they\\'ll live \\nin leisure if only they escape their illness. Then they reflect on how \\nuselessly they made provision for things they wouldn\\'t live to enjoy, \\nand how fruitless was all their toil. (2) But why should life not be \\nample for people who spend it far removed from all business? None \\nof it is made over to another, none scattered in this direction or that; \\nnone of it is entrusted to fortune, none wasted through neglect; none \\nis lost through being given away freely, none is superfluous; the whole \\nof life yields a return, so to speak. And so, however short, it is amply \\nsufficient; and for that reason, whenever his last day comes, the sage \\nwill not hesitate to go to his death with a sure step. \\n\\n(12.1) You perhaps want to know whom I\\'d term the preoccu- \\npied? Don\\'t imagine that I mean only those lawyers who are driven \\nout of the law court only when the watchdogs are finally let in for \\nthe night; or those patrons you see crushed either with impressive \\ndisplay in their own crowd of admirers or more contemptuously in \\nsomeone else\\'s crowd; or those clients whose duties summon them \\nfrom their own houses in order to dash them against the doors of \\nothers; or those the praetor\\'s spear keeps busy for disreputable gain \\nwhich is someday bound to fester. 17 (2) Even the leisure of some \\n\\n\\n\\npeople is preoccupied: in their country retreat or on their couch, in \\nthe midst of their solitude, and even though they\\'ve withdrawn from \\neveryone, they are troubling company for themselves; their existence \\nis to be termed not leisurely but one of idle preoccupation. Do you \\ncall a man at leisure who arranges with meticulous attention to detail \\nhis Corinthian bronzes, which are made so expensive by the collect- \\ning mania of a few, and who spends most of the day on rusty strips \\nof copper? Or a man who sits at a wrestling ring (for — shame on \\nus! — we suffer from vices that are not even Roman), enthusiasti- \\ncally watching boys brawling? Who separates the troops of his own \\nwell-oiled wrestlers into pairs of the same age and skin color? Who \\nmaintains a stable of the freshest athletes? (3) Tell me, do you call \\nthose people leisured who spend many hours at the barber\\'s while \\nany overnight growth is trimmed away, solemn consultation is taken \\nover each separate hair, and disheveled locks are rearranged or thin- \\nning hair is combed forward from both sides to cover the forehead? \\nHow angry they get if the barber has been a little too careless, as if \\nhe were cutting a real mans hair! How they flare up if anything is \\nwrongly cut off their precious mane, if a hair lies out of place, or if \\neverything doesn\\'t fall back into its proper ringlets! Which of those \\npeople wouldn\\'t rather have their country thrown into disarray than \\ntheir hair? Who isn\\'t more concerned about keeping his head neat \\nrather than safe? Who wouldn\\'t rather be well groomed than well \\nrespected? You call leisured these people who are kept busy between \\nthe comb and the mirror? (4) What about those who are absorbed in \\ncomposing, listening to, and learning songs? The voice, whose best \\nand simplest flow is naturally straightforward, they twist into sinuous \\nturns of the most feeble crooning. Their fingers are always snapping \\nin time to some song that they carry in their head, and when they\\'ve \\nbeen asked to attend to serious and often even sorrowful matters, you \\ncan overhear them quietly humming a tune. Theirs isn\\'t leisure but \\nidle occupation. (5) And heaven knows! I\\'d not class their banquets \\namong leisurely pastimes, because I see how anxiously they arrange \\ntheir silver plate, how carefully they gather up the tunics of their \\npretty boys-at-table, how they are on tenterhooks to see how the \\nboar turns out from the cook, how quickly the smooth-skinned slaves \\nhurry to discharge their duties at the given signal, how skillfully \\nbirds are carved into carefully shaped portions, and how attentively \\n\\n\\n\\nwretched little slave boys wipe away the spittle of drunks. By these \\nmeans they seek a reputation for refinement and sumptuous living, \\nand their evils follow them into every corner of their lives to such \\nan extent that they cannot eat or drink without ostentation. (6) Nor \\nwould I count among the leisured those who have themselves carried \\naround in a sedan chair and litter, and who arrive precisely on time \\nfor their rides, as if they were forbidden to skip them; and who have \\nto be reminded of their scheduled time for bathing, for swimming, or \\nfor dining: they are so enervated by the excessive sloth of a pampered \\nmind that they can\\'t tell by themselves if they are hungry. (7) I hear \\nthat one of these pampered creatures — if pampered is the right word \\nfor unlearning life and normal human practice — was manually lifted \\nout of the bath and set down in his sedan chair, and asked: \"Am I now \\nseated?\" Do you think that someone like this, who doesn\\'t know if \\nhe is sitting, knows whether he\\'s alive, whether he can see, whether \\nhe\\'s at leisure? It\\'s hard for me to say whether I pity him more if he \\nreally didn\\'t know as much or if he pretended not to know. (8) They \\nare oblivious to many things, but they also affect forgetfulness of \\nmuch. They find certain vices pleasing as evidence of their prosper- \\nity: to know what you\\'re doing seems to be the mark of a man who\\'s \\nlowly and contemptible. What folly to think that mime actors 18 feign \\nmany details in order to attack luxury! Truth be told, they pass over \\nmore than they fabricate, and such a wealth of unbelievable vices \\nhas arisen in an age that has applied its fertile talents in this one \\ndirection that by now we can charge the mime actors with ignoring \\nthem. To imagine that there\\'s anyone so ruined by pampering that \\nhe takes another\\'s word as to whether he\\'s seated! (9) So here is not \\na person of leisure; you should apply a different term to him. He is \\nsick or rather as good as dead; the truly leisured person is one who is \\nalso conscious of his own leisure. But a person who needs a guide to \\nmake him aware of his own bodily positions is only half-alive; how \\ncan he be in control of any of his time? \\n\\n(13. 1) It would be a long business to run through the individual \\ncases of people who\\'ve spent their whole lives playing checkers or \\nplaying ball, or baking their bodies in the sun. People whose plea- \\nsures put them to considerable work are not at leisure. For instance, \\nnobody will doubt that those who devote their time to useless lit- \\nerary questions — Rome too now has a significant number of such \\n\\n\\n\\npeople — are busily engaged in doing nothing. 19 (2) It was once the \\nwell-known failing of the Greeks to ask how many rowers Ulysses \\nhad, whether the Iliad or the Odyssey was written first, and also \\nwhether they belong to the same author, and other questions of the \\nsame stamp which, if you keep them to yourself, do nothing to im- \\nprove your private knowledge; and if you divulge them, you\\'re made \\nto appear not more learned but more annoying. (3) And now this \\nvacuous enthusiasm for acquiring useless knowledge has infected the \\nRomans as well. Only a few days ago I heard someone 20 mentioning \\nwhich Roman general had been the first to do what: Duilius was \\nthe first to win a battle at sea, 21 Curius Dentarus the first to parade \\nelephants in a triumph. 22 So far, even if such items as these hardly \\nsteer us toward true glory, they still involve models of service to the \\nstate; such knowledge isn\\'t going to profit us, but it\\'s nevertheless of \\nthe sort to hold our interest because its subject matter, though empty, \\nis appealing. (4) We may also excuse investigators who ask who first \\npersuaded the Romans to deploy a naval force (it was Claudius, 23 who \\nwas called Caudex for this reason, because the ancients termed the \\ncomposite structure of several planks a caudex\\\\ hence the public rec- \\nords are called codices, and the barges which carry provisions up the \\nTiber are still called codicariae in accordance with ancient practice). \\n(5) Doubtless also this may have some relevance — the fact that Va- \\nlerius Corvinus was the first to conquer Messana, 24 and was the first \\nof the family of the Valerii to be called Messana after appropriating \\nthe name of the captured city; common usage gradually changed the \\nlettering, so he became Messalla. (6) But will you also allow interest \\nin the fact that L. Sulla was the first to display lions off the leash in \\nthe circus, 25 though as a general rule they were shown in chains, and \\nthat javelin throwers were supplied by king Bocchus 26 to dispatch \\nthem? All right, let\\'s allow that as well; but is any useful purpose re- \\nally served by knowing that Pompey was the first to put on a fight in \\nthe circus involving eighteen elephants, 27 with noncriminals arrayed \\nagainst them in mock battle? A leader of the state and a man of out- \\nstanding kindliness, as his reputation has it; among leaders of old, he \\nthought it a memorable form of spectacle to destroy human beings \\nin unheard-of fashion. \"They fight to the death? That\\'s not enough. \\nThey\\'re torn to pieces? Not enough: let them be utterly crushed by \\nanimals of massive bulk!\" (7) It would certainly be preferable for such \\n\\n\\n\\nstuff to be forgotten, for fear that some future strongman might learn \\nof it and be envious of an utterly inhuman episode. O what dark- \\nness great prosperity casts on our minds! He thought he was above \\nthe laws of nature when he was throwing so many hordes of human \\nwretches to beasts born under a different sky, when he was arrang- \\ning war between such disparate creatures, when he was shedding so \\nmuch blood before the eyes of the Roman people — people he\\'d later \\nforce to shed still more blood themselves. But this same man was \\nlater taken in by Alexandrian treachery and offered himself to be run \\nthrough by the meanest of his chattels; 28 then at last he recognized \\nthe empty boast that was his own surname. 29 \\n\\n(8) But to return to the point from which I digressed, and to \\ndemonstrate the futility of the pains that some people take in these \\nsame matters: the same source 30 reported that Metellus, in his tri- \\numph after conquering the Carthaginians in Sicily, was alone of all \\nRomans in having 120 captured elephants led in procession before \\nhis chariot; 31 and that Sulla was the last Roman to extend the pome- \\nrium, which it was the custom of old to extend after the acquisition \\nof Italian, but never provincial, territory. 32 Is there any more ben- \\nefit in knowing this than to know that the Aventine Hill is outside \\nthe pomerium, according to him, for one of two reasons: either be- \\ncause that was the rallying point for the plebeians in secession from \\nRome, 33 or because the birds had not been propitious when Remus \\ntook the auspices there; 34 and to know countless other items besides \\nthat are either crammed with lies or improbable? (9) For even if you \\ngrant that people say all these things in good faith, and even if they \\nguarantee the truthfulness of their writing, whose mistakes will such \\nitems of information make fewer? Whose passions will they hold in \\ncheck? Whom will they make braver, or more just, or more generous \\nof spirit? My friend Fabianus used to say that he sometimes won- \\ndered whether it was better to apply oneself to no researches at all \\nthan to be embroiled in these. \\n\\n(14.1) Of all people, they alone who give their time to philosophy \\n\\' are at leisure, they alone really live. For it\\'s not just their own lifetime \\nthat they watch over carefully, but they annex every age to their own; \\nall the years that have gone before are added to their own. Unless \\nwe prove most ungrateful, those most distinguished founders of hal- \\nlowed thoughts came into being for us, and for us they prepared a \\n\\n\\n\\nway of living. We are led by the work of others into the presence of \\nthe most beautiful treasures, which have been pulled from darkness \\nand brought to light. From no age are we debarred, we have access \\nto all; and if we want to transcend the narrow limitations of hu- \\nman weakness by our expansiveness of mind, there is a great span of \\ntime for us to range over. (2) We can debate with Socrates, entertain \\ndoubt with Carneades, 35 be at peace with Epicurus, overcome hu- \\nman nature with the Stoics, and go beyond it with the Cynics. 36 \\nSince nature allows us shared possession of any age, why not turn \\nfrom this short and fleeting passage of time and give ourselves over \\ncompletely to the past, which is measureless and eternal and shared \\nwith our betters? (3) As for those who run about performing their so- \\ncial duties, agitating themselves and others: when they\\'ve duly acted \\nlike madmen, when they\\'ve crossed every threshold on their daily \\nrounds and passed no open door, and when they\\'ve delivered their \\nmoneygrubbing greeting to houses very distant from one another, \\nhow few patrons will they be able to catch sight of in a city so vast \\nand so fragmented by varied passions! (4) How many patrons will \\nthere be whose sleep or self-indulgence or churlishness denies their \\ncallers access! How many who, after they\\'ve tortured them with the \\nlong wait, pretend to be in a hurry as they pass them by! How many \\nwill avoid going out through a reception hall packed with clients \\nand make their escape through a door that\\'s hidden from view, as if \\nit were not even cruder to deceive them than to refuse them admit- \\ntance! How many, half- asleep and weighed down by the effects of \\nyesterday\\'s drinking, will yawn with utter disdain and address those \\nwretched clients, who cut short their own sleep in order to wait on \\nanother\\'s, by the right name only after it\\'s been whispered to them \\na thousand times over by lips that hardly move! 37 (5) Do we suppose \\nthese clients spend time on morally commendable duties? But we \\ncan say as much of those who\\'ll want to have Zeno, Pythagoras, \\nDemocritus, and the other high priests of philosophical study, and \\nAristotle and Theophrastus, as their closest companions every day. \\nNone of these will ever be unavailable to you, none of these will fail \\nto send his visitor off in a happier condition and more at ease with \\nhimself. None will let anyone leave empty handed; they can be ap- \\nproached by all mortals by night and by day. \\n\\n(15.1) None of these philosophers will force you to die, but all will \\n\\n\\n\\nteach you how. 38 None of them will diminish your years, but each will \\nshare his own years with you. With none of them will conversation \\nbe dangerous, friendship life threatening, or cultivation of them ex- \\npensive. From them you\\'ll take whatever you wish; it will be no fault \\nof theirs if you fail to take in the very fullest amount you have room \\nfor. (2) What happiness, what a fine old age lies in store for the per- \\nson who\\'s put himself under the patronage of these people! He\\'ll have \\nfriends whose advice he can seek on the greatest or least important \\nmatters, whom he can consult daily about himself, from whom he \\ncan hear the truth without insult and receive praise without fawning, \\nand who will provide a model after which to fashion himself. \\n\\n(3) There is a common saying that it was not in our power to \\nchoose the parents we were allotted, and that they were given to us by \\nchance; yet we can be born to whomever we wish. There are house- \\nholds of the most distinguished intellects: choose the one into which \\nyou\\'d like to be adopted, and you\\'ll inherit not just the name but also \\nthe actual property, which is not to be hoarded in a miserly or mean \\nspirit: the more people you share it with, the greater it will become. \\n(4) These will open for you the path to immortality, and raise you to \\nan elevation from which no one is cast down. This is the sole means \\nof prolonging mortality, or rather of transforming it into immortality. \\nHonors, monuments, all that ostentatious ambition has ordered by \\ndecree or erected in stone, are soon destroyed: there\\'s nothing that \\nthe long lapse of time doesn\\'t demolish and transform. But it cannot \\nharm the works consecrated by wisdom: no age will efface them, \\nno age reduce them at all. The next age and each one after that will \\nonly enhance the respect in which they are held, since envy focuses \\non what is close at hand, but we more freely admire things from a \\ndistance. (5) So the sage\\'s life is ample in scope, and he\\'s not con- \\nstricted by the same limit that confines others. He alone is released \\nfrom the limitations of the human race, and he is master of all ages \\nas though a god. Some time has passed? He holds it in recollection. \\nTime is upon us? He uses it. Time is to come? This he anticipates. \\nThe combining of all times into one makes his life long. \\n\\n(16. 1) But for those who forget the past, disregard the present, \\nand fear for the future, life is very brief and very troubled. When \\nthey reach the end of it, they realize too late, poor wretches, that \\nthey\\'ve been busied for so long in doing nothing. (2) And the fact \\n\\n\\n\\nthat they sometimes pray for death need hardly be taken as evidence \\nthat their life is long. In their folly they are afflicted by fickle feel- \\nings that rush them into the very things they fear; they often pray \\nfor death precisely because they fear it. (3) And there\\'s no reason to \\nfind evidence that they live long in the fact that the day often seems \\nlong to them, or that they complain that the hours pass slowly until \\nthe appointed hour for dinner arrives; for when their usual preoc- \\ncupations fail them and they are left with nothing to do, they fret \\nwithout knowing how to apply their free time or how to drag it out. \\nAnd so they move on to some other preoccupation and find all the \\nintervening time burdensome, precisely as they do when a gladiato- \\nrial show has been announced for a given day, or when the date of \\nsome other show or amusement is keenly awaited, and they want to \\nskip over the days in between. Any postponement of something they \\nlook forward to is long to them. (4) But the time of actual enjoyment \\nis short and fleeting, and made far shorter by their own fault; for they \\ndesert one pleasure for another and cannot persist steadily in any one \\ndesire. Their days aren\\'t long but hateful; yet, on the other hand, how \\nshort seem the nights that they spend cavorting with prostitutes or \\ndrinking! (5) Hence the mad inspiration of poets too who feed hu- \\nman frailty by their stories and imagine that Jupiter actually doubled \\nthe length of the night 39 when seduced by sexual pleasure. All this \\ninflaming of our worst passions amounts to nothing but enlisting \\nthe gods as setting a precedent for our vices, and giving a license for \\ncorruption that is justified by divine example. How can the nights \\nthat they pay for so dearly not seem so very short to these people? \\nThey lose the day in looking forward to the night, the night in fear \\nof the dawn. \\n\\n(17.1) The very pleasures of such people are anxious and disturbed \\nby various kinds of alarm, and at the very moment when they are \\nrejoicing the agitated thought steals in on them: \"How long will this \\nlast?\" It is this feeling that has caused kings to weep over their own \\npower; the extent of their prosperity gave them no pleasure, but the \\nprospect of its eventual end terrified them. (2) When that exceed- \\ningly arrogant king of the Persians ranged his army over the vast \\nplains and could only measure its size, not count it, he wept at the \\nthought that within a century not one soldier from that huge force \\nwould still be alive. 40 Yet the very man who wept was destined to \\n\\n\\n\\nbring their fate on them, to lose some troops at sea, others on land, \\nsome in battle, 41 others in flight, and so to destroy in a very short \\ntime all those for whose hundredth year he feared. (3) And what of \\nthe fact that even the joys of such people are anxiety ridden? This is \\nbecause they don\\'t rest on stable causes but are disrupted as frivo- \\nlously as they are produced. But what do you think their times are \\nlike when they are wretched even by their own admission, since even \\nthe joys which lift and transport them above their fellow men are by \\nno means unmixed? (4) All the greatest blessings cause anxiety, and \\nfortune is never less wisely trusted than when at its most advanta- \\ngeous. To maintain prosperity we need fresh prosperity, and other \\nprayers are to be offered instead of those that have already turned \\nout well. Everything that comes our way by chance is unsteady, and \\nthe hi\\'gher our fortunes rise, the more susceptible they are to falling. \\nBut what must inevitably collapse gives no one pleasure; and so the \\nlife of those who acquire through hard work what they must work \\nharder to possess is necessarily very wretched, and not just very brief. \\n(5) They obtain with great effort what they desire, and they anx- \\niously hold on to what they\\'ve obtained; and meanwhile they give no \\nconsideration to time\\'s irretrievability. New preoccupations take the \\nplace of old, hope arouses new hope, ambition new ambition. They \\ndon\\'t look for an end to their wretchedness, but change the cause of \\nit. We\\'ve been tormented by our own public office? We spend more \\ntime on somebody else\\'s. We\\'ve stopped toiling as candidates? We \\nstart canvassing for others. We\\'ve given up the vexation of being a \\nprosecutor? We take on that of being a judge. A man stops being a \\njudge? He starts presiding over a special commission. A man\\'s spent \\nall his working life managing other people\\'s property for a salary? \\nHe\\'s diverted by looking after his own wealth. (6) Marius was done \\nwith army service, and the consulship kept him busy. 42 Quintius hur- \\nries to get through his dictatorship, but he\\'ll be called back to it from \\nhis plow. 43 Scipio will go up against the Carthaginians before being \\nfully ready for such an undertaking. 44 Victorious over Hannibal, vic- \\ntorious over Antiochus, he will win distinction in his own consulship \\nand act as surety for his brother\\'s consulship; 45 and but for his own \\nobjections, his statue would be placed in Jupiter\\'s company in the \\nCapitoline temple. But discord among the citizens will bring trouble \\nto their savior, and after he has scorned as a young man public honors \\n\\n\\n\\nrivaling those of the gods, in old age he\\'ll eventually take pleasure \\nin an ostentatiously defiant exile. Reasons for anxiety will never be \\nwanting, whether because of prosperity or wretchedness. Life will be \\ndriven on through one preoccupation after another; we shall always \\npray for leisure but never attain it. \\n\\n(18.1) And so, my dearest Paulinus, remove yourself from the \\ncrowd and, storm-tossed more than your years deserve, withdraw \\nat last to a more peaceful haven. Consider how many waves you\\'ve \\nendured and, on the one side, how many storms you\\'ve weathered in \\nprivate and, on the other, how many you\\'ve brought on yourself in \\nyour public career. Long enough has your virtue been demonstrated \\nthrough toilsome and unceasing proofs; put to the test what it can \\nachieve in leisure. The greater part of your life, and certainly the \\nbetter part, has been given to the state: take some of your time for \\nyourself as well. (2) It\\'s not to a sluggish and idle state of inaction \\nthat I summon you, or to drown all your lively energy in sleep and \\nin the pleasures that are dear to the crowd. That\\'s not to find peace \\nof mind: you\\'ll find tasks to busy yourself about in serene seclusion \\nthat are more important than any you\\'ve dealt with so energetically \\nthus far. (3) You manage the revenues of the world, it is true, as scru- \\npulously as you would a stranger\\'s, as diligently as you would your \\nown, as conscientiously as you would the state\\'s. You win affection \\nin a post in which it is hard to avoid being hated. Yet it is neverthe- \\nless better — believe me — to know the balance sheet of one\\'s own \\nlife than that of the public grain supply. (4) Recall that energetic \\nmind of yours, which is supremely qualified to deal with the greatest \\nchallenges, from an office that is certainly eminent but is hardly in \\nkeeping with the happy life. And consider that you didn\\'t make it \\nyour aim, with all your training in the liberal arts from the earliest \\nage, for many thousands of grain measures to be safely entrusted to \\nyou; you\\'d shown promise of something greater and higher. There\\'ll \\nbe no shortage of men of both scrupulous good character and dili- \\ngent service. But slow-moving pack animals are far better suited to \\ncarrying heavy loads than thoroughbred horses; who ever hampered \\nthe fleetness of these well-bred creatures with a weighty burden? \\n(5) Consider, moreover, how stressful it is to subject yourself to such \\na heavy responsibility; you have to deal with the human stomach, \\nand a hungry people neither submits to reason nor is soothed by fair \\n\\n\\n\\ntreatment or influenced by any entreaty. Only recently, within those \\nfew days after Gaius Caesar died, he was still pained to the utmost \\n(if the dead have any consciousness) because he saw that the Roman \\npeople survived him and still had enough rations for seven or at all \\nevents eight days; because he made his bridges of boats and played \\nwith the empire\\'s resources, 46 we faced the worst kind of disaster even \\nfor people under siege: a shortage of food. His imitation of a crazed \\nforeign king of ill-fated arrogance almost came at the cost of mass \\ndestruction by starvation, and of the general catastrophe that follows \\nfamine. (6) What was the frame of mind of the officials in charge of \\nthe grain supply when they were destined to face stones, weapons, \\nfires, and Gaius? With the greatest concealment they covered over \\nsuch a great sickness lurking amid the state\\'s innermost organs, and \\nwith good reason, to be sure. For certain complaints are to be treated \\nwithout the patient\\'s being aware of them; knowing about their dis- \\nease has caused many to die. \\n\\n(19. 1) Retire to those pursuits that are calmer, safer, and more \\nimportant. Do you think it amounts to the same thing whether you\\'re \\nin charge of seeing that imported grain is transferred to the granaries \\nundamaged by either the dishonesty or the carelessness of the trans- \\nporters, that it doesn\\'t absorb moisture and then get spoiled through \\nheat, and that it corresponds to the declared weight and measure; or \\nwhether you occupy yourself with these hallowed and lofty studies, \\nso as to learn the substance of god, his will, his general character, \\nand his shape; what outcome awaits your soul; where nature lays us \\nto rest upon release from our bodies; what it is that bears the weight \\nof all the heaviest matter of this world in the center, suspends the \\nlight components above, carries fire to the highest part, and rouses \\nthe stars to their given changes of movement; and to learn other such \\nmatters in turn that are full of great wonders? (2) You really ought \\nto leave ground level and turn your mind\\'s eye to these studies. Now, \\nwhile enthusiasm is still fresh, those with an active interest should \\nprogress to better things. In this mode of life much that is worth \\nstudying awaits you: the love and practice of the virtues, forgetful- \\nness of the passions, knowledge of how to live and to die, and deep \\nrepose. \\n\\n(3) The plight of all preoccupied people is wretched, but most \\nwretched is the plight of those who labor under preoccupations that \\n\\n\\n\\nare not even their own, whose sleep schedule is regulated by some- \\nbody else\\'s, who walk at somebody else\\'s pace, and who are under \\ninstructions in that freest of all activities — loving and hating. 47 If \\nthese people want to know how short their life is, let them reflect on \\nhow small a part of it is their very own. \\n\\n(20.1) So, when you see a man repeatedly taking up the robe \\nof office, or a name well known in public, don\\'t envy him: those \\ntrappings are bought at the cost of life. For one year to be dated by \\ntheir name, they\\'ll waste all their own years. 48 Life deserts some of \\nthem amid their first struggles, before the arduous climb up to the \\npeak of their ambition. Some, after they\\'ve clambered up through a \\nthousand indignities to arrive at the crowning dignity, are assailed by \\nthe wretched thought that all their toil has been for an inscription \\non an epitaph. Some map out new aspirations for their extreme old \\nage as if in their youth, and they succumb to weakness amid their \\ngreat and immoderate endeavors. (2) It\\'s a shameful end when an old \\nman acting in court for litigants who are perfectly unknown to him \\nbreathes his last even at the moment when he\\'s winning the applause \\nof impressionable bystanders. It\\'s a disgraceful end when the man \\nwho\\'s sooner worn out by living than by working drops dead in the \\nmiddle of his duties; and a disgraceful end when a man dies in the act \\nof going over his accounts and draws a smile from the heir who\\'s long \\nbeen kept waiting. (3) I can\\'t pass over one example that occurs to me. \\nGaius Turannius was an old man of proven diligence who was past \\nninety when, on the emperor\\'s initiative, he was granted retirement \\nfrom his administrative post by Gaius Caesar; 49 he gave instructions \\nfor himself to be laid out on his bed and to be mourned by his as- \\nsembled household as if he were dead. The house lamented its elderly \\nmaster\\'s unemployment and didn\\'t cease their mourning until his job \\nwas restored to him. Is it really such a pleasure to die preoccupied? \\n(4) Yet many have that same attitude, and their desire for work lasts \\nlonger than their capacity for it. They struggle against their bodily \\ninfirmity, and old age itself they adjudge a hardship for no other rea- \\nson than because it removes them from office. The law doesn\\'t draft \\na soldier after fifty, it doesn\\'t require a senator\\'s attendance after sixty: \\nit\\'s harder for people to obtain retirement from themselves than from \\nthe law. (5) All the time while they plunder and are plundered and \\nbreak in on each other\\'s rest and make each other miserable, life is \\n\\n\\n\\nwithout profit, without pleasure, without any progress of mind. No \\none holds death in view, no one refrains from distant hopes. Indeed, \\nsome people even make arrangements for things beyond life — huge \\ntomb structures, dedications of public buildings, gladiatorial shows \\nfor the funeral, and ostentatious funeral processions. Yet in truth, the \\nfunerals of such people should be conducted by the light of torches \\nand wax tapers, 50 as if they\\'d lived for the briefest span. \\n\\n\\n'"
